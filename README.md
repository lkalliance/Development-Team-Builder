## Description

The Development Team Builder is a CLI application that accepts input from the user about employees on their development team, and outputs an HTML file with that information arranged in an org-chart-type layout.

## Installation Instructions

The Development Team Builder runs on Node.js. This version was developed and tested on version 18.13.0. It has two dependencies, both third-party modules available through npmjs: email-validator (v. 2.0.4) and inquirer (v. 8.2.4). The output file is best read in any web browser.

## Usage Information

To use the Development Team Builder, within Node.js run the index.js file at the top level of the application's directory.

The user is first asked to enter the information of the Manager (name, employee id, email and phone). Subsequently (and as many times as the user likes), they are asked if they would like to enter another employee: either an Engineer (name, employee id, email and GitHub id) or an Intern (name, employee id, email and school). The third option is to indicate that they are done entering employees.

There is some validation as the user enters the information:
* Employee id's must be unique
* Email addresses must be of proper format: with an @ and a proper domain extension
* Phone numbers must be at least seven digits

Once the user has indicated they are done, the Development Team Builder generates a file, `./dist/index.html`, which the user can view in any Web browser. Re-running the application overwrites this file.

Here is a [video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLi8YvojMX5QrqChyq7Zivtxi2LwzCJP/view?usp=sharing) of the application in action.

## Credits

The Develpment Team Builder would not be possible without the creators and contributors to the Node.js project, as well as the Inquirer and Email-validator modules. Nor would it have been possible without the guidance of the University of Minnesota Full Stack Coding Bootcamp instructional and tutorial staff.

Further guidance came from the wisdom of coders around the Web, most particluarly from [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com), the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com), among others.
